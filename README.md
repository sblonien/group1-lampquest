# Quick Start
* To start MySQL server, use:
`mysql-ctl start`

* To access the database, use:
`mysql -uroot lampquest`

* To start application server, use:
`node index.js`
You can then preview the running application. You can also start your application using `nodemon index.js`. Using nodemon will automatically reflect the changes made in the files while server is running. nodemon package is not available by default. You need to install it using `npm install -g nodemon`.
